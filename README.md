# Weather-App.github.io
A dynamic Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide real-time weather information.
I developed a web application displaying real-time weather data for user-specified locations.
Implemented a search bar for location input and displayed weather information like temperature, description, and icons.
Utilized OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's location or specified city.
Demonstrated additional functionalities like geolocation or weather forecasts.
